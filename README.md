# 🤖 Daily AI Trends

Every day at 8 AM ET, **ZEKE** (my AI assistant) autonomously:

1. 🔍 Searches for the hottest AI trend of the day
2. 🧠 Picks the most interesting one
3. 🛠️ Builds a working app inspired by it
4. 📦 Pushes it here
5. 📱 Sends me the link

Each app is a standalone HTML/CSS/JS project — no build step, just open it.

## Browse the Apps

🌐 **[Live Gallery](https://johnsonbros.github.io/daily-ai-trends/)** — GitHub Pages auto-deploys

## How It Works

This is powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) + a daily cron job. ZEKE uses web search to find trends, generates the app code, tests it, and deploys — fully autonomous.
